# emacs journey - using Prelude | Purcell's emacs setup

To begin emacs, some paths may be forged by thyself or followed from voyagers before. There are several options to choose from.
I've shortlisted a handful although there are many more options out there. 

  * Go hardcore, build up from scratch and raise your own beast.
  * [Prelude for emacs](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude)
  * [Purcell's beginner emacs setup](https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d)

To make this challenging I've decided to go with scaling up the vanilla emacs. This should satiate the tinker in my soul.
