# emacs Extensions of Promise

Leveraging packages to improve and customize the emacs experience is well known.
In the interest of using certain packages incrementally, I'll document these in parts.

Other packages which seem of interest and would likely be added at a later stage will be
cataloged in the *wishlist* section. 

Also, there's a *maybe* section. These are packages that I've not vetted but would like to. 
They may eventually move to the wishlist or become part of packages in use.
