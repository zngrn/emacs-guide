# emacs Guide


### A Brief History of Failure

Over the last decade, I've wrestled with many editors/IDEs. There was always a sense of dissatisfaction.

While `vi*` did seem to be an able ally, things still didn't feel quite alright. Let's not bicker over it here.
Such conversations are better reserved for indulgence over a :wine_glass: or smoking some :herb:.

`emacs` has always been something that I've played and left behind due to time mismanagement. 

### What's on here anyway?

These collection of notes should allow me (and perhaps a few others, if any) to gain some leverage with `emacs`.

### Setup

  * Get `emacs`
  * Read along and play with things.
  * If you wish to have a better grasp over key bindings, I'd recommend using [anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) and learning via spaced-repetition.

### Recommended Reading Order

  Are you a fan of chaos? Prefer some randomness? Then pick any file; *else*:
  * [emacs-101](./guide/emacs-101.md)
  * [emacs-forged-paths](./guide/emacs-forged-paths.md)
  * [emacs-ftw](./guide/emacs-ftw.md)
  * [emacs-extensions-of-promise](./guide/emacs-extensions-of-promise.md)
